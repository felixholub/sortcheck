# SORTCHECK
This is a simple program which checks whether data are already sorted as wished. Only if not, Stata is asked to sort. Stata also makes such a check but it takes longer.

# Installation

In Stata, simply run
```
cap ado uninstall sortcheck
net install sortcheck, from(https://github.com/felixholub/sortcheck/raw/master/src/)
```
